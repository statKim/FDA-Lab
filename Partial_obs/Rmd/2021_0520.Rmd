# Completion - Delaigle setting

- Delaigle et al. (2020) setting
- 20% outlier + partially observed
- 5 FPC scores
- 50 repetitions
- pre-smoothing X
- M-est 기반 방법(M-est, Kraus-M 등)에서 noise variance를 가정한 경우도 요약
  - 결과적으로, noise var을 빼주더라도 completion이 더 smooth한 경향은 보이지 않음
    - Yao, Huber는 raw 데이터를 smoothing하지 않는 대신 covariance를 smoothing하여 결과적으로 completion이 smooth한 형태로 나오게 됨
    - 반면, Kraus 방법은 pre-smoothing을 하지 않으면 중간에 smoothing 과정이 없어 다소 wiggly한 형태를 보이게 되는 것으로 보임
