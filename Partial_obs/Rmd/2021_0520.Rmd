# Simulation

## Settings
- **Completion**
  - Delaigle et al. (2020) setting
  - 20% outlier + partially observed
  - 5 FPC scores
  - 50 repetitions
- **Clustering**
  - shifted Doppler signal setting
    - 4개 true clusters
    - 512 => 128 timepoints로 줄여서 확인
  - 20% outliers + partially observed
  - Huber의 경우, variance가 0이 되는 양끝 부분은 가장 가까운 값으로 대체
  - 2 FPC scores
  - Trimmed $k$-means clustering 적용 (outlier 비율만큼 trim되도록 설정)
  - 50 repetitions
- **비교 방법론**
  - **Yao (2005)** : PCA (CE)
  - **Huber** : Lin & Wang (2020) + Huber loss function + PCA (CE)
  - **M-est** : Marginal M-estimator for mean and covariances + PCA (CE)
  - **M-est (smooth)** : M-est + 2D smoothed covariance + PCA (CE)
  - **Kraus (2015)** : PCA (Kraus)
  - **Kraus-M** : M-est + PCA (Kraus)
  - **Kraus-M (smooth)** : M-est (smooth) + PCA (Kraus)
- pre-smoothing 적용 X
